<h2>THE TALE OF JASPER JAY</h2>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_1" id="p_1">p. 1</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h3>A NOISY ROUGE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the feathered folk in Pleasant
Valley said that old Mr. Crow was the
noisiest person in the neighborhood. But
they must have forgotten all about Mr.
Crow's knavish cousin, Jasper Jay. And
it was not only in summer, either, that
Jasper's shrieks and laughter woke the
echoes. Since it was his habit to spend his
winters right there in Farmer Green's
young pines, near the foot of Blue Mountain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_2" id="p_2">p. 2</a></span>on many a cold morning Jasper's
ear-splitting "<i>Jay! jay!</i>" rang out on the
frosty air.</p>

<p>At that season Jasper often visited the
farm buildings, in the hope of finding a
few kernels of corn scattered about the
door of the corn-crib. But it seemed to
make little difference to him whether he
found food there or not. If he caught the
cat out of doors he had good sport teasing
her. And he always enjoyed that.</p>

<p>Jasper was a bold rowdy&mdash;but handsome.
And Farmer Green liked to look
out of the window early on a bleak morning
and see him in his bright blue suit
frisking in and out of the bare trees. Still,
Farmer Green knew well enough that Jasper
Jay was a rogue.</p>

<p>"He reminds me of a bad boy," Johnnie
Green's father said one day. "He's mischievous
and destructive; and he's forever
screeching and whistling. But there's<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_3" id="p_3">p. 3</a></span>
something about him that I can't help liking....
Maybe it's because he always
has such a good time."</p>

<p>"He steals birds' eggs in summer,"
Johnnie Green remarked.</p>

<p>"I've known boys to do that," his father
answered. And Johnnie said nothing
more just then. Perhaps he was too busy
watching Jasper Jay, who had flown into
the orchard and was already breakfasting
on frozen apples, which hung here and
there upon the trees.</p>

<p>When warm weather came, the rogue
Jasper fared better. Then there were insects
and fruit for him. And though Jasper
took his full share of Farmer Green's
strawberries, currants and blackberries,
he did him no small service by devouring
moths that would have harmed the grapes.</p>

<p>But in the fall Jasper scorned almost
any food except nuts, which he liked more<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_4" id="p_4">p. 4</a></span>
than anything else&mdash;that is, if their shells
were not too thick. Beechnuts and chestnuts
and acorns suited him well. And he
was very skilful in opening them. He
would grasp a nut firmly with his feet and
split it with his strong bill. Johnnie
Green could not crack a butternut with his
father's hammer more quickly than Jasper
could reach the inside of a sweet beechnut.</p>

<p>Though Jasper hated to spend any of
his time during the nutting season by doing
much else except <i>eat</i>, he was so fond
of nuts that he always hid away as many
as he could in cracks and crevices, and
buried them under the fallen leaves.</p>

<p>You see, he was like Frisky Squirrel
in that. He believed in storing nuts for
the winter. But since he had no hollow
tree in which to put them, it was only natural
that he never succeeded in finding<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_5" id="p_5">p. 5</a></span>
every one of his carefully hidden nuts. He
left them in so many different places that
he couldn't remember them all. Those
that he lost in that fashion often took root
and grew into trees. And so Jasper Jay
helped Farmer Green in more ways than
one.</p>

<p>But no doubt Jasper would have
shrieked with laughter had anybody suggested
such an idea to him.</p>

<h3>A BLOW FOR THE BULLY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper Jay</span> had some queer notions in his
head. One of them was that a person
couldn't be happy unless he was making
a great deal of noise. And if there was
anything that roused Jasper's wrath, it
was the sight of some quiet, modest little
neighbor who minded his own affairs and
had little to say.</p>

<p>There was one such chap who made his
home in a wild grapevine that grew upon
the stone wall in front of the farmhouse.
His name was Mr. Chippy; and he was
never known to do anybody the least bit
of harm. On the contrary, he was quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_7" id="p_7">p. 7</a></span>
helpful to Farmer Green's wife, for he
went to the farmhouse almost every day
and cleared the crumbs off the kitchen
doorstep.</p>

<p>But Jasper Jay complained that Mr.
Chippy was altogether too humble.</p>

<p>"He never says anything except '<i>Chip,
chip, chip, chip</i>,'" Jasper often remarked.
"And his voice is so high and
thin that anybody would think he was a
little old lady, to hear him. He's too quiet
to get on in the world. And as for a good
time, I don't believe he ever had one in all
his life."</p>

<p>Jasper said a good many other unpleasant
things about mild Mr. Chippy. And
one day when the saucy rascal had nothing
better to do he flew over to the stone
wall just to talk to Mr. Chippy and tell
him what he thought of him.</p>

<p>"Hi there, red-head!" Jasper Jay<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_8" id="p_8">p. 8</a></span>
shouted. "Come out here on the wall! I
want to see you."</p>

<p>Mr. Chippy thrust his chestnut crowned
head through the leaves of the wild
grapevine. And one could hardly say
that he looked pleased. Like most people,
he was not overjoyed by Jasper Jay's visits.
But he crept on top of the stone wall
and <i>chipped</i> a how-dy-do to his caller.</p>

<p>"That's no way to greet anybody!"
cried Jasper Jay, rudely. "If you want
to make a person feel that he is welcome
you ought to speak up good and loud&mdash;and
slap him on the back. And you must
look happy, too."</p>

<p>Little Mr. Chippy smiled faintly.</p>

<p>But Jasper Jay was not satisfied.</p>

<p>"You don't look happy!" he scoffed.
"You appear as if you had a pain somewhere.... Come,
now! Let me hear you
give a hearty laugh!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_9" id="p_9">p. 9</a></span></p>

<p>If Mr. Chippy had known that his caller
was going to be so rude he would have
stayed hidden in the wild grapevine. And
now he wished that Jasper would go away
and leave him in peace. As for laughing,
he saw nothing at all to laugh at.</p>

<p>"You'd better do as I tell you!" Jasper
Jay warned him. And he raised his crest
and stamped angrily upon the stone wall.
"You're altogether too <i>quiet</i>. I want you
to laugh <i>loud</i>.</p>

<p>"You're going to be happy, if I have to
break every bone in your body," Jasper
added.</p>

<p>Naturally, that threat did not help little
Mr. Chippy to laugh. Instead, he
looked quite worried. He knew that Jasper
Jay was a bully. And there was no
telling what he might do to anyone so
small as Mr. Chippy was. So he tried his
best to please Jasper. But he was so up<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_10" id="p_10">p. 10</a></span>set
that he could manage only a feeble
"<i>Chip, chip, chip, chip!</i>"</p>

<p>"That'll never do," Jasper told him.</p>

<p>"Maybe this will, then," said Mr.
Chippy, quietly. And darting at Jasper
Jay, he knocked him off the stone wall before
Jasper knew what was happening.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay was furious. He scrambled
quickly back upon the wall. But Mr.
Chippy had vanished. He had dived
under the cover of the grapevine and hid
in a chink between the stones, where Jasper
could not find him.</p>

<p>"I declare&mdash;" said Jasper Jay at last&mdash;"I
declare, he's got away from me!" And
so Jasper went off, shaking his head. He
had never supposed that mild Mr. Chippy
would dare do anything so bold as to knock
anybody off a stone wall.</p>

<p>It is plain that Jasper Jay had never
learned that one can be brave without<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_11" id="p_11">p. 11</a></span>
boasting. And as he flew off across the
road toward the river, Jasper thought he
heard a peculiar noise from the depths of
the wild grapevine.</p>

<p>It was only Mr. Chippy, chuckling to
himself. For Jasper had made him quite
happy, after all&mdash;though not exactly in
the way that the blue-coated bully had intended.</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_12" id="p_12">p. 12</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h3>THE STRANGE CRY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> you may already know, Jasper Jay was
a vain fellow. And it was not only of his
brilliant blue suit that he was proud. He
was greatly pleased with his own voice,
though many of the feathered folk thought
it harsh and disagreeable. But, that, perhaps,
was because they seldom or never
heard Jasper's sweeter, flute-like notes, or
the soft, low chatter which he kept for his
most intimate friends.</p>

<p>What most of his acquaintances knew
and disliked was Jasper's noisy "<i>Jay!
jay!</i>" But even that discordant cry suited
Jasper very well. And he often boasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_13" id="p_13">p. 13</a></span>
that there wasn't another bird in Pleasant
Valley that could make a greater racket
than he.</p>

<p>To be sure, there was Jasper's cousin,
old Mr. Crow. His "<i>Caw, caw</i>" could be
heard half a mile away, if the wind was
right. But Jasper Jay always insisted
that his own voice was much stronger than
Mr. Crow's. And nobody troubled himself
to dispute Jasper's claim.</p>

<p>So Jasper Jay had little to worry about
until at last something happened that
made him feel quite uneasy. It was almost
noon on a hot summer's day; and
Jasper was resting amid the shade of a big
beech tree on the edge of the woods, where
he could look across the meadow and
watch Farmer Green and his boy Johnnie
and the hired-man at work in the hayfield.
Jasper was just thinking how much
pleasanter was his own carefree life than<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_14" id="p_14">p. 14</a></span>
theirs when a long, loud call blared across
the meadow. He had never heard that cry
before; and he raised himself on tiptoe,
listening intently as the sound echoed
back and forth across the valley.</p>

<p>Though Jasper stayed quite still for
some time, waiting to hear the cry again,
it was not repeated.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what sort of bird that
was!" he said to himself at last. "If he
stays in this neighborhood I'll have to
drive him away, for his voice is certainly
louder than mine. And I wouldn't let him
come here and insult me like that."</p>

<p>All the afternoon Jasper Jay flew up
and down the length of Pleasant Valley
and back and forth across it, hunting for
the strange bird with the loud voice. But
he met no newcomer at all.</p>

<p>Jasper had almost decided that the
stranger had merely been passing through<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_15" id="p_15">p. 15</a></span>
the valley. He certainly hoped that such
was the case, because he had no way of
telling how big the unknown might be. If
he were as large as his voice, driving him
away might prove no joke for Jasper.</p>

<p>By nightfall Jasper began to feel less
anxious. To be sure, he dreamed that he
met an enormous bird on the top of Blue
Mountain, who chased him all the way
around the world. And when he awoke
just before daybreak he was still frightened,
until he remembered that it was only
a dream.</p>

<p>"It must have been that fuzzy caterpillar
that I ate just before I went to bed,"
he thought.</p>

<p>Jasper was himself again all the morning.
He had a good deal of fun teasing a
kitten which had lost itself behind Farmer
Green's barn. And he drove Jolly Robin's
wife almost frantic by hiding in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_16" id="p_16">p. 16</a></span>
orchard and whistling like a hawk. And
then, at midday, his fun was spoiled. That
strange scream smote his ears once more.
And Jasper trembled both with rage and
fear.</p>

<p>He knew then that the stranger was still
in the valley.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_17" id="p_17">p. 17</a></span></p>

<h3>JASPER'S BOAST</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper Jay</span> had said nothing to anyone
concerning the horrid call, which had
sounded twice&mdash;each time at midday. But
now that he felt sure the strange bird
whose cry he had heard must have come to
live in Pleasant Valley, he could no longer
keep from mentioning the matter.</p>

<p>Chancing to meet his cousin, Mr. Crow,
the next morning, Jasper stopped to talk
with the old gentleman. You see, Mr.
Crow was widely known as a gossip. He
usually knew what was going on in the
neighborhood. So Jasper thought it likely
that Mr. Crow could tell him all about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_18" id="p_18">p. 18</a></span>
unwelcome stranger. "Perhaps," he
thought, "the old scamp has already seen
him."</p>

<p>Of course, Jasper never termed his
cousin a scamp to his face. He always
spoke to him very politely, greeting him as
"Mr. Crow," in spite of their close relationship.
And there was a reason why
Jasper did that. Mr. Crow had once given
him a severe beating because Jasper had
called him something else. And Jasper
Jay never forgot it.</p>

<p>Now Jasper first inquired after his
cousin's health. He did that to put old
Mr. Crow in a good humor. But Jasper
was sorry at once that he had started Mr.
Crow to talking about his ills. It happened
that the old gentleman was then
suffering from gout, hay-fever and housemaid's
knee. And he liked to talk about
his ailments. Living all alone as he did,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_19" id="p_19">p. 19</a></span>
he had nobody to do his housework. And
that, he complained, was the reason why
his knee troubled him.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay fidgeted about while Mr.
Crow was telling him all that&mdash;and much
more&mdash;concerning his troubles. Jasper
really did not care to hear about them.</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" he exclaimed impatiently,
for it seemed to him that old Mr. Crow
never would stop talking about himself.
"Now that we're having a good spell of
weather you ought to begin to feel better.
And what's the news, Mr. Crow? Have
you heard of anything happening around
here lately?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman shook his head.</p>

<p>"Things are quiet," he said.</p>

<p>"Nobody left Pleasant Valley recently?"
Jasper inquired.</p>

<p>"Not that I've heard of," replied Mr.
Crow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_20" id="p_20">p. 20</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>No strangers come here to live?</i>" Jasper
asked him.</p>

<p>"No one at all!" said Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>"That's queer!" Jasper exclaimed. "I
was sure I heard a new voice yesterday.
And I heard it again to-day, too&mdash;at exactly
the same time."</p>

<p>"What did it sound like?" Mr. Crow
wanted to know.</p>

<p>So Jasper gave an imitation of the odd
cry that had swept the valley.</p>

<p>"It was quite loud and very unpleasant
to hear," he remarked. "And whoever
the stranger may be, if he's going to
disturb me every noon like that when I'm
having my midday rest I shall have to
drive him out of the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"It's almost noon now," said old Mr.
Crow, cocking his eye at the sun. "Perhaps
we'll hear the cry soon."</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his bill<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_21" id="p_21">p. 21</a></span>
when a far-reaching call caught the attention
of the two cousins. It brought
Jasper Jay to his tiptoes at once. And he
craned his neck in an effort to catch a
glimpse of the stranger who possessed
such a powerful voice.</p>

<p>"There it is!" Jasper cried. "There's
the call again! Do you know what kind
of bird makes that cry?"</p>

<p>Something seemed to have stuck in Mr.
Crow's throat. At least, he spluttered and
choked and coughed. And he was quite
unable to answer just then. But after the
mountains had quit tossing the sound
back and forth and all was quiet again he
said:</p>

<p>"No small bird could make a sound like
that. And if you can drive him out of
Pleasant Valley you're a better fighter
than I ever supposed."</p>

<p>Mr. Crow might have known that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_22" id="p_22">p. 22</a></span>
remark would not please Jasper Jay. Jasper
gave his cousin an angry glance; and
he looked as if he would have liked to fight
<i>him</i>. But he had suffered one beating by
his elderly cousin. And he didn't care for
another. So he only sneered openly. And
then he screamed in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"I'll find that noisy fellow and drive
him out of Pleasant Valley, if it takes me
all summer to do it!" And he raised his
crest, and snapped his beak together, and
stamped his feet, so that he looked very
fierce indeed.</p>

<p>But old Mr. Crow was not frightened in
the least. He only smiled.</p>

<p>"Let me know when you've driven the
stranger away," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! you'll hear about it," Jasper Jay
assured him. "It will be the most famous
fight that will ever take place in this valley,"
he boasted. And then the two cous<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_23" id="p_23">p. 23</a></span>ins
parted. It did not put Jasper Jay in
any better humor to hear Mr. Crow's
hoarse <i>haw-haw</i> echoing across the valley.
Of course, Jasper did not know what
he was laughing at. But that only served
to make the blue-coated scamp all the more
peevish.</p>

<h3>THE SEARCH</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> telling Mr. Crow what he was going
to do to the strange bird, which he had
never seen, but only heard, Jasper Jay
renewed his search for the unknown.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt in his
mind that the stranger could out-scream
him. And he knew he could never be
happy so long as such a loud-voiced rival
remained in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Jasper hoped, at least, that the newcomer
was not too large.</p>

<p>"He can't be very big, or I'd have found
him before this," he reassured himself.</p>

<p>Though he hunted far and wide, look<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_25" id="p_25">p. 25</a></span>ing
in hollow trees and in the tops of the
tallest timber, as well as inside the densest
thickets, Jasper could still find no trace
of his enemy&mdash;for so he regarded the unknown
bird.</p>

<p>For several days he continued his unsuccessful
search. And though that same
strange cry enraged him each noon, he
was quite at a loss to know where to look
for its author. He asked a good many of
the feathered folk if they had seen a
stranger anywhere. But not one of them
admitted that he had.... Jasper Jay
thought it very odd.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he took special pains to
dodge his cousin, old Mr. Crow, whenever
he caught sight of him; for he remembered
Mr. Crow's disagreeable remark. But the
day finally came when Jasper met him
face to face in the woods. And Mr. Crow
called to him loudly to wait a moment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_26" id="p_26">p. 26</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to ask you," said the old gentleman,
"whether you've found and driven
away that stranger yet?" The old rogue's
voice cracked as he spoke and he rocked
back and forth as if he were much amused
by something.</p>

<p>"I haven't set eyes on him yet," Jasper
replied somewhat coldly. "But I've heard
him every noon. And I expect to find him
pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Have you looked for him around the
farmhouse?" Mr. Crow inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" said Jasper. "I hadn't
thought of his being there."</p>

<p>"Then," said old Mr. Crow, "I'd go
over there at once, if I were you. And I'd
stay right there until noon. You won't
have to wait more than three or four hours.
And unless I'm much mistaken you'll find
your search at an end...."</p>

<p>"I hope&mdash;" he added&mdash;"I hope you<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_27" id="p_27">p. 27</a></span>
won't get hurt when you fight the
stranger."</p>

<p>Now, it struck Jasper Jay that old Mr.
Crow knew more about the strange bird
with the loud voice than he was willing to
tell. Anyhow, Mr. Crow looked very wise.
And he croaked and smiled in a way that
was most annoying. What he said about
Jasper's not getting hurt made Jasper
feel quite uneasy, too.</p>

<p>"Won't you come with me?" he asked
Mr. Crow very politely. To tell the truth,
Jasper was worried. Now that he was
about to meet the strange bird he began to
be frightened. He did not like the thought
of facing him alone.</p>

<p>"I can't come now," said Mr. Crow,
"because I'm going to be busy. But I'll
join you on the barnyard fence a little before
midday. Maybe I'll bring a friend
or two along with me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_28" id="p_28">p. 28</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" cried Jasper Jay. "That will
be fine."</p>

<p>So they said good-by. And Mr. Crow
hurried off into the woods, for&mdash;as he said&mdash;he
was going to be busy.</p>

<h3>A JOKE ON JASPER JAY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a loud squall of glee, Jasper Jay
made off in the direction of the farm
buildings. Now that he was going to have
company, later, he felt much better. And
he resolved to keep well hidden in the top
of the great oak near Farmer Green's
house, until the time came for Mr. Crow
to arrive&mdash;and his friends, too, if he
brought them.</p>

<p>Jasper waited in the big oak for a long
time. He saw no strange bird. And he
was glad&mdash;because he did not want to meet
him until Mr. Crow came.</p>

<p>For once in his life Jasper kept quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_30" id="p_30">p. 30</a></span>
still. He could see a kitten playing in the
dooryard; and he would have liked to
tease it. And there were the hens, too.
Jasper smiled as he thought of the way
they would scurry for shelter if he should
cry out like a hawk. But he made no
noise, for he was afraid the strange bird
might be lurking about somewhere, ready
to pounce upon him before Jasper knew
what was happening.</p>

<p>At last Jasper left his hiding place and
flew beyond the barn, where he alighted
on the fence, to meet Mr. Crow. And very
promptly the old gentleman arrived. He
brought ten of his relations with him, too&mdash;all
noisy and unmannerly fellows. They
were not the least bit timid, because they
knew that Farmer Green and his son
Johnnie and the hired-man were working
in the hayfield, beyond the pasture.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" cried Mr. Crow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_31" id="p_31">p. 31</a></span>
"We've come to see you whip the person
with the loud voice and drive him out of
the valley." And all ten of his relations
joined Mr. Crow in a loud, cackling laugh.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" asked Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no joke at all&mdash;yet," said
Mr. Crow. And he and his companions all
laughed again. "Come around to the other
side of the barn," Mr. Crow continued.
"It's time for the stranger to screech, for
it'll be noon before you know it."</p>

<p>So they all moved to another part of the
fence, from which they could see the farmhouse.
And no sooner had they settled
themselves comfortably than Farmer
Green's wife came to the doorway and
held a horn to her lips.</p>

<p>Then came the loud blast that Jasper
knew so well. He was so startled that he
almost fell off the fence. But he was not
frightened.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_32" id="p_32">p. 32</a></span></p>

<p>He was very angry, however. For Mr.
Crow and his friends began to jeer at him.</p>

<p>"Fly at her!" cried Mr. Crow. "She's
the bird that you're going to drive out of
Pleasant Valley. And we all want to see
you do it."</p>

<p>It was very uncomfortable for Jasper
Jay. He had mistaken the sound of the
dinner-horn for the call of a strange bird.
And he felt uncommonly foolish.</p>

<p>Since he dared not attack Mr. Crow, especially
when his ten relations were with
him, there was nothing Jasper could do
except give a loud, helpless scream of rage
and hurry away toward the woods.</p>

<p>"See those crows chasing that blue
jay!" Farmer Green said to Johnnie, as
they walked toward home. "Probably
he's played some trick on them."</p>

<p>But for once it was not Jasper who was
guilty. It was old Mr. Crow himself who<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_33" id="p_33">p. 33</a></span>
had played the trick. He had known from
the first that Mrs. Green had bought a new
dinner-horn, because the men were always
late for dinner. Though how he discovered
that fact is a mystery.</p>

<p>Somehow, old Mr. Crow knew about
everything that happened in Pleasant Valley.
And now Jasper Jay had learned
something more, too.</p>

<h3>SCARING THE HENS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was one sport of which Jasper Jay
was over-fond. He loved to imitate the
calls of other birds; and Jasper was such
a good mimic that he often deceived his
neighbors by his tricks.</p>

<p>It was not pleasant for a sober, elderly
bird-gentleman to come home at night
from a hard day's work and have his wife
accuse him of idling away his time.</p>

<p>"You can't deny it&mdash;for I could hear
you laughing in the woods!" she might
say.</p>

<p>And it was not always an easy task to
convince her that what she had heard was<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_35" id="p_35">p. 35</a></span>
nobody but that noisy rascal, Jasper Jay,
playing a trick on her.</p>

<p>Nor did Jasper limit his droll teasing
to his own neighbors. Sometimes he hid
in a tree near the farm buildings and
frightened the hens by making a sound
exactly like a certain red-shouldered
hawk, who lived in the low woods along
Black Creek, where frogs were plentiful.
A fierce scream of "<i>Kee-you! kee-you!</i>"
was quite enough to alarm an old hen with
a big family of young chickens. Though
she might know well enough that the red-shouldered
hawk seldom made a meal of
poultry, preferring frogs and field-mice
above all other food, it was only natural
that she shouldn't care to take any
chances. The haste with which a nervous
mother-hen called her family into the
chicken house when she heard that cry of
"<i>Kee-you! kee-you!</i>" always amused Jas<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_36" id="p_36">p. 36</a></span>per
Jay, for he never tired of the game.</p>

<p>Surprising as it may seem, now and
then Jasper's hawk-call deceived even
Farmer Green himself. And sometimes
he would step into the kitchen and take
his old gun off the hooks on the wall above
the wide fireplace and hurry outside again
in the hope of getting a shot at Mr. Hawk.
It happened at last that in some way Mr.
Red-shouldered Hawk heard of this trick
of Jasper's. And that old gossip, Mr.
Crow, warned Jasper Jay that he had
better be careful.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawk says that you are giving
him a bad name with Farmer Green,"
Mr. Crow told Jasper one day. "Farmer
Green calls him 'that old hen-hawk,' and,
of course, it's not very pleasant for Mr.
Hawk to have somebody looking for him
with a gun. I know what the feeling is
like, myself," said old Mr. Crow. "Be<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_37" id="p_37">p. 37</a></span>lieve
me, it's enough to make one most uncomfortable!"</p>

<p>But Jasper Jay only shrieked with
laughter.</p>

<p>"You'll sing a different song if Mr.
Hawk catches you," Mr. Crow snapped.</p>

<p>And that made Jasper Jay scream all
the louder. Then he stopped laughing and
said "<i>Caw! caw!</i>" in a husky voice so like
Mr. Crow's own that the old gentleman
spluttered and fumed and all but chased
Jasper out of the woods where they were
sitting at the time.</p>

<p>They never did get along well together&mdash;old
Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay. They
were cousins, you know. But that fact
did not help matters at all. Perhaps they
knew too much about each other.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me!" said Jasper
Jay at last.</p>

<p>"Very well!" Mr. Crow replied stiffly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_38" id="p_38">p. 38</a></span>
"But remember&mdash;I've warned you!" he
croaked. And then he flew away to his
nest in a tall elm, overlooking the cornfield.</p>

<h3>A BIT OF MISCHIEF</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper Jay</span> did not heed Mr. Crow's warning.
When he learned that Mr. Red-shouldered
Hawk was angry with him because
he had imitated Mr. Hawk's fierce
cry, "<i>Kee-you! kee-you!</i>" Jasper was
more pleased with himself than ever.
Scaring Farmer Green's hens with that
piercing scream had been a good deal of
fun. But making Mr. Hawk angry was
still more.</p>

<p>So Jasper Jay began to visit the farmyard
even oftener than before. If the
mother-hens, with their chicks, did not
happen to be scratching in the barnyard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_40" id="p_40">p. 40</a></span>
there was always sport of some sort to be
had.</p>

<p>One day when Jasper was on his way to
Farmer Green's place, he happened to
meet a blue jay friend of his known as
Noisy Jake, because he was not very quiet.
In fact, one could almost always hear his
voice ringing through the woods.</p>

<p>"You seem to be in a hurry," Noisy
Jake bawled. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"S-sh!" said Jasper. "I'm going to the
farmyard to have some fun scaring the
hens. But I don't want everybody to know
it. Do you want to come along?"</p>

<p>Noisy Jake promptly said he did. So
the two rascals hurried across the pasture
and over the meadow toward the farm
buildings.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;&mdash;" said Jasper Jay, when they
had reached the farmyard&mdash;"now I'll hide
in this oak here and you can hide in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_41" id="p_41">p. 41</a></span>
one there." He pointed to a tree a little
further from the chicken house than the
one where he intended to perch. Naturally,
it was not like Jasper Jay to give
the best seat to anybody else.</p>

<p>"What'll we do then?" Noisy Jake
asked.</p>

<p>"You see those hens," said Jasper.
"I'm going to scream like Mr. Red-shouldered
Hawk. And you'll laugh when the
hens hurry their chicks out of the
way.... If you want to, you may scream
too&mdash;but not till after I have."</p>

<p>Noisy Jake agreed to Jasper's plan.
And he quickly disappeared among the
branches of the oak to which Jasper had
sent him.</p>

<p>Then Jasper just had to stop and laugh
to himself over the fright he was going to
give the old hens. He was about to open
his mouth to imitate the cry of Mr. Hawk<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_42" id="p_42">p. 42</a></span>
when something happened that made him
terrible angry.</p>

<p>"<i>Kee-you! kee-you!</i>" The fierce scream
rang out over the farmyard. And immediately
the mother-hens called to their children,
with frantic <i>clucks</i>, to run for their
lives into the chicken house.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay did not laugh at all over the
way the chicks scurried out of sight.</p>

<p>"Noisy Jake has played a mean trick on
me!" he said to himself. "He went and
screamed before it was his turn!"</p>

<p>Since he didn't want to miss <i>all</i> the fun,
Jasper let out a blood-curdling "<i>Kee-you!
kee-you!</i>" himself, just to hurry the last
hen under cover. But, somehow, he had
to confess to himself&mdash;though he wouldn't
have admitted it to anybody else&mdash;he had
to confess that Noisy Jake's cry sounded
far more like Mr. Hawk's than did his
own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_43" id="p_43">p. 43</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, that did not make Jasper feel
any pleasanter. He wished he had not
told Noisy Jake where he was going.</p>

<p>"I'll punish him for his meddling!"
Jasper exclaimed. And he flew straight
for the tree where Noisy Jake had hidden.</p>

<p>But Jasper did not reach the tree.</p>

<p>"<i>Kee-you! kee-you!</i>" The cry came
from above his head. And looking up,
Jasper Jay saw Mr. Red-shouldered
Hawk himself, dropping down like lightning
out of the sky.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawk paid not the slightest attention
to the frightened hens and their
chicks. He seemed to have eyes only for
Jasper Jay. And on his proud, cruel face
there was a look of anger that made Jasper
wish he had never, never imitated Mr.
Hawk's cry.</p>

<p>He was sorry now, that he had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_44" id="p_44">p. 44</a></span>
heeded Mr. Crow's warning. But his
cousin, old Mr. Crow, was always looking
solemn and croaking loudly about "trouble."
It was no wonder that people paid
little attention to what he said.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<h3>JASPER HAS TO HIDE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jasper Jay looked up and saw Mr.
Red-shouldered Hawk darting down upon
him from above, he dodged to one side and
screamed loudly for help.</p>

<p>His friend Noisy Jake was known as a
great fighter. And Jasper hoped that together
they might be able to drive Mr.
Hawk away.</p>

<p>But he was disappointed. Noisy Jake
did not appear. And there was a good
reason why he did not. At that very moment
he was flying off across the meadow
as fast as his beautiful wings could carry
him. He had seen Mr. Hawk circling<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_46" id="p_46">p. 46</a></span>
above the barnyard. And he had lost no
time in making his escape.</p>

<p>But Jasper Jay knew nothing of all
that. And when he found that there was
no one to help him he was just as frightened
as the hens had been. He knew that
he was no match for Mr. Hawk. And he
had no wish to make a meal for him. Jasper
was quite willing to leave that pleasure
to the frogs that splashed their time
away along the banks of Black Creek.</p>

<p>For a few moments Jasper ducked first
one way and then another. He had several
narrow escapes. And there's no telling
what might have happened if he hadn't
suddenly decided that he would follow the
hens' example.</p>

<p>So without even stopping to knock on
the door he dashed into the chicken house
and alighted on a roost in the darkest corner
he could find.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_47" id="p_47">p. 47</a></span></p>

<p>For two excellent reasons Mr. Red-shouldered
Hawk did not follow him.
First, he had always made it a rule never
to go inside one of Farmer Green's buildings.
And second, he happened to catch a
glimpse of Farmer Green running into
the house through the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawk knew what that meant.
Farmer Green was going for his gun!
And so he winged his way swiftly toward
Black Creek, hoping&mdash;as he went&mdash;that he
had taught Jasper Jay a lesson.</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>Meanwhile, there was a great uproar in
the chicken house. But Farmer Green
paid no attention to that&mdash;supposing, of
course, that it was merely because of the
fright the hawk had given the hens.</p>

<p>For once there was more noise than even
Jasper Jay liked. It appeared that there
was a bold young rooster in the chicken<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_48" id="p_48">p. 48</a></span>
house. And he objected to Jasper Jay's
presence.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by coming in here
where you're not wanted?" he screamed.
"Where are your manners?"</p>

<p>Actually, Jasper Jay wondered what the
rooster was talking about. Never having
had any manners, Jasper didn't know the
meaning of the word. And since he could
not answer, he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Stick your spurs into him and maybe
he'll speak!" screeched a pert young hen.</p>

<p>Jasper looked at the rooster then; and
he saw that the brazen fellow wore long,
sharp spurs upon his legs. They looked
almost as wicked as Mr. Hawk's cruel talons.</p>

<p>"Please," said Jasper, "I've come in to
get out of the way of Mr. Hawk."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the rooster. "Unless I'm
mistaken you're the rogue that's always<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_49" id="p_49">p. 49</a></span>
frightening the ladies by screaming like
Mr. Hawk. So I don't see why you should
object to his society."</p>

<p>"I was only fooling," Jasper Jay
whined. "I meant no harm, you know.
Let me stay here a while and I promise
you I won't bother the hens again."</p>

<p>"I accept your apology, as well as your
promise," the rooster replied with great
dignity. And then he began crowing in
a manner that was most annoying to Jasper
Jay. It was the same as saying, "This
rascal's afraid of me!"</p>

<p>That was true, too. And that was what
made the crowing sound so unpleasant in
Jasper's ears.</p>

<p>He left as soon as he dared show himself
out of doors. And he sometimes remarked
afterward that a chicken house
wouldn't be a bad place to live in, after
all, if it weren't for the roosters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_50" id="p_50">p. 50</a></span></p>

<p>"They boast too much," said Jasper
Jay. "Nothing could induce me to listen
to their silly crowing. And to tell the
truth, I don't see how the hens manage to
stand it."</p>

<h3>THE NUTTING PARTY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time Jasper Jay had been waiting
for something. It was fall; and he
impatiently watched the tree-tops on the
side of Blue Mountain change from their
quiet summer green to hues of flaming
gold and red. Though they were beautiful,
to tell the truth Jasper did not in the
least care what color a tree was. So long
as it bore nuts, he was satisfied. And to
him the turning leaves meant only that the
autumn was lengthening&mdash;and the nuts
were growing ripe.</p>

<p>That was what Jasper Jay was waiting
for. And as soon as the frosts came and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_52" id="p_52">p. 52</a></span>
burst open the prickly pods that covered
the beechnuts he intended to lead the first
nutting party of the season to the place
where the beeches grew.</p>

<p>Now, going a-nutting with a crowd is
much more fun than gathering nuts alone.
And Jasper usually preferred a nutting
party of a dozen blue jays. Then he always
had twelve times as much fun as he
could have just by himself&mdash;because there
was twelve times the noise.</p>

<p>So on the very first day that the nuts
were ready to be eaten Jasper Jay asked
eleven friends to join him. As it happened,
Jasper found a company of twelve
waiting for him at the appointed time on
the edge of the woods. Somehow, Noisy
Jake (whom Jasper hadn't invited) had
heard of the party. And he invited himself.</p>

<p>Jasper was not at all pleased when<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_53" id="p_53">p. 53</a></span>
he found that Noisy Jake intended to go
a-nutting too. He had not yet forgiven
that boisterous rowdy for not having
warned him, when Mr. Red-shouldered
Hawk was sailing about over Farmer
Green's barnyard, and Jasper had to seek
safety in the chicken house.</p>

<p>Jasper gave Jake a cool nod and turned
his back on him. But it would have taken
a great deal more than that to hurt Noisy
Jake's feelings. Indeed, he was so impudent
that he immediately imitated Mr.
Hawk's cry, "<i>Kee-you! kee-you!</i>"</p>

<p>It gave Jasper a great start to hear that
screech behind his back. He jumped into
the air and alighted with his face toward
Noisy Jake, having turned around while
his feet were off the ground.</p>

<p>Jake was laughing loudly at his own
joke, while all the rest&mdash;except Jasper&mdash;squalled
with delight.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_54" id="p_54">p. 54</a></span></p>

<p>Jasper Jay thought for a moment that
he would have to fight Jake on the spot.
But he was in such a hurry to get to the
place where the beeches grew that he decided
to pay no more attention to the rude
fellow.</p>

<p>"Come on!" Jasper cried. "Follow
me!" And he made for the beech grove
at top speed, with the nutting party following
close behind him.</p>

<p>There was a great squawking and
screaming and whistling as the nutting
party flew into the tops of the beech trees
and the nuts began rattling down upon
the ground.</p>

<p>But their fun did not last long. Another
nutting party, led by Johnnie Green,
arrived at the grove soon after them; and,
of course, that put an end to their sport.
They knew that boys not only whistled but
threw stones as well.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_55" id="p_55">p. 55</a></span></p>

<p>It was most disappointing. And Jasper
and his friends were feeling quite
peevish when Noisy Jake suddenly cried:</p>

<p>"Let's go over to the oak woods! There
are plenty of acorns there; and we can
have lots of fun!"</p>

<p>All the crowd&mdash;except Jasper Jay&mdash;shouted
something that sounded like
"Hurrah!" And before Jasper knew
what was happening everybody had
started for the oak woods. This time it
was Noisy Jake that led the nutting party.
And all Jasper could do was to follow with
the others.</p>

<p>He was no longer the leader. And he
was very, very angry. It had been his
party, in the first place. And there was
Noisy Jake, whom he had not even invited
to it, acting as if he were the one who
should say what should&mdash;or shouldn't&mdash;be
done.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_56" id="p_56">p. 56</a></span></p>

<p>Jasper could see Jake talking with some
of the others. And he couldn't help feeling
that they were talking about <i>him</i>.
Jake laughed loudly now and then; and
although he was flying fast, he looked
around occasionally, to make sure that
the party was following him. Seeing that
Jasper was the last of the procession, Jake
shouted to him that he had better hurry, if
he didn't want to be left behind.</p>

<p>And that made Jasper Jay more indignant
than ever.</p>

<h3>A STROKE OF LUCK</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper's</span> fun would have been spoiled if
he hadn't had a stroke of good fortune.
Since he was no longer leading the nutting
party he wanted to prevent his friends
from following Noisy Jake to the place
where the oak trees grew, to have an acorn
hunt.</p>

<p>It was no more than anybody could expect
that Jasper should feel sulky. It
had been his party in the first place. So,
of course, he didn't enjoy seeing somebody
else take the lead away from him.
Most unhappy he was, as he hurried along
the mountain-side, when he happened, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_58" id="p_58">p. 58</a></span>
at once, to catch sight of a huge, grayish-brown
figure, half hidden among some
hemlock boughs. Jasper Jay knew right
away that it was Mr. Solomon Owl.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!" Jasper cried to his
friends. "Wait a bit! Here's some fun!"</p>

<p>So the nutting party checked their flight
and returned, while Jasper pointed out
Solomon Owl's motionless form to them.</p>

<p>They forgot all about the acorn hunt,
for the time being, because there was nothing
they liked better than teasing Solomon
Owl&mdash;when there were enough of them.
In case any of the blue-coated rascals met
Mr. Owl alone, he was most polite to him,
for Solomon was not only big and strong
but he had sharp talons and a hooked beak.</p>

<p>Those thirteen blue jays, however, knew
that they had little to fear from the solemn
old chap, so long as they kept out of
reach of his claws.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_59" id="p_59">p. 59</a></span></p>

<p>They began jeering at Solomon Owl.
And some of them even tried to mock his
queer cry, "<i>Whoo-whoo-too-whoo-too-o-o!</i>"
The woods echoed with their hoots.
And Noisy Jake shouted:</p>

<p>"This is luck! Aren't you all glad I
found him?"</p>

<p>Now, of course, Jake had not found Solomon
Owl. If it hadn't been for Jasper
Jay no one would have known he was
there. And Jasper was just about to remind
Jake of his mistake when he happened
to think of something that made
him change his mind. It occurred to Jasper
that if Noisy Jake wanted to think he
was still the leader of the party perhaps
it was just as well to let him. Jake always
talked so much, in such a loud tone, that
Solomon Owl would be sure to know him.</p>

<p>And Jasper thought he could have
plenty of fun himself, teasing Solomon<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_60" id="p_60">p. 60</a></span>
and not saying a word. Then&mdash;so Jasper
believed&mdash;then Solomon Owl wouldn't
know that Jasper was in the party at all.</p>

<p>You see, Johnnie Green was not the
only person who held that Solomon Owl
couldn't see in the daytime. Everybody
knew that his big, round eyes were keen
enough in the dark. But in the daylight
he usually sat quite still in a tree and
stared as if he saw nothing at all.</p>

<p>Well, that was just what Solomon Owl
was doing then. He said never a word.
And he scarcely moved, except to turn his
head helplessly now and then, and blink,
while his tormentors flew as close to him
as they dared and hooted loudly at him.</p>

<p>Jasper and his friends made enough
noise to scare even a bigger bird than Solomon
Owl. And they said a good many
rude things to him, too.</p>

<p>"How are Farmer Green's chickens<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_61" id="p_61">p. 61</a></span>
this fall?" Noisy Jake asked him in a
loud voice, while Jasper Jay quietly
amused himself by dropping hemlock
seeds upon Solomon's head.</p>

<p>Still Solomon Owl made no remarks at
all. But he was thinking deeply. And
though some people claimed that he was
not nearly so wise as he looked, there were
some things that he knew just as well as
anyone else.</p>

<p>But Jasper Jay was not aware of that.</p>

<h3>SOLOMON OWL'S EYES</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a while Jasper Jay saw that his
friends were growing tired of teasing Solomon
Owl. So he said to them suddenly,
in what was for him a low voice, "Let's go
hunt acorns now!" And he flew off with
a pleased grin upon his face, for he hoped
that he had made trouble for Noisy Jake.
His friends all followed him, too, while
Noisy Jake hurried on behind them, trying
to overtake and pass Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>But he never headed Jasper all the way
to the oak woods. And Jasper had a good
time there, making all the noise he pleased
and eating so many acorns that he made<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_63" id="p_63">p. 63</a></span>
himself almost ill.... If that isn't having
a good time, then somebody must be
mistaken.</p>

<p>Now, it was quite natural for Jasper
Jay to think that he had nothing to fear
from Solomon Owl. To be sure, he had
flown back and forth in front of Solomon's
round, staring eyes; and he had dropped
hemlock seeds upon Solomon's head. But
he felt quite safe, because he was <i>sure</i> Solomon
Owl couldn't see him in the daylight.
Furthermore, he had said hardly a word,
so Solomon shouldn't know, from his
voice, that Jasper was teasing him.</p>

<p>When he met Solomon, therefore, right
after sunset that same day, as Jasper was
hurrying home from the oak woods to get
his night's sleep and Solomon Owl was
just starting out on his nightly wanderings,
Jasper spoke boldly to the big, bulky
fellow.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_64" id="p_64">p. 64</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Owl!" said he. "I
hope you're well, and that you had a good
rest to-day."</p>

<p>Solomon Owl turned his head in Jasper's
direction and stared at him for a
moment. And then he hooted long and
loud.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know it," said Jasper&mdash;though
he had no idea what Solomon Owl
was saying.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Jasper began to feel
a bit uneasy. There was something terrifying
in Solomon's odd cry, especially
when the dark was falling fast and Jasper
Jay was still some distance from home.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, young fellow!" said
Solomon Owl in a deep, hollow voice.
"I've something to say to you. Weren't
you roaming through the woods with a
crowd of rowdies this afternoon?"</p>

<p>Jasper Jay couldn't deny it. But he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_65" id="p_65">p. 65</a></span>
didn't want to admit it, either. So he
said:</p>

<p>"I believe Noisy Jake led a nutting
party this way."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Solomon Owl. "They
didn't pick any hemlock seeds, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I'll ask them," Jasper Jay murmured.
"And I'll let you know to-morrow." He
turned away, because he didn't care to
talk any longer. His voice was too faint.
And his legs felt strangely weak. For
Jasper Jay was thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry!" Solomon Owl's
queer voice boomed. "Some people think
I can't see in the daytime. But they're
very much mistaken. And nobody ever
dropped hemlock seeds on my head yet
without my knowing it."</p>

<p>Jasper Jay did not wait to hear anything
more. He sprang into the air and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_66" id="p_66">p. 66</a></span>
tore off through the forest, just before
Solomon Owl jumped.</p>

<p>For a heavy gentleman who was big
around the waist, Solomon Owl was surprisingly
quick. But Jasper Jay was even
quicker. And it was lucky for him that he
left when he did, for Solomon felt very,
very hungry. He had had nothing to eat
since dawn.</p>

<p>But he made his rush in vain. Missing
Jasper Jay by a few inches, he crashed
head foremost into a tree before he could
stop. And the pain in the top of his head
made him hoot at the top of his voice. Perhaps
he was angry, too.</p>

<p>Anyhow, to Jasper Jay the horrid cry
sounded as if it were just behind him. He
never knew before that he could fly so
fast. And some of his friends, who saw
a blue streak in the twilight, did not even
recognize him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_67" id="p_67">p. 67</a></span></p>

<p>For several days afterward, Noisy Jake,
whom Jasper passed in his headlong flight,
talked about the blue lightning he had seen
when he was going home from the nutting
party. And since nobody could prove that
he was mistaken, no one was so foolish as
to dispute him.</p>

<p>And that was the way that Jasper Jay
learned something about Solomon Owl's
eyes&mdash;and something about manners, too.</p>

<h3>TEASING A SINGER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> there were many feathered folk
in Pleasant Valley, Jasper Jay did not
care to have much to do with any except
his own family. Unless he had other business
that was more urgent he was always
ready to join a troop of noisy blue jays
bent on some mischief. But if there were
none of his own kind about, Jasper usually
preferred to be alone.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Jasper did not even
like to hear other birds singing. He
claimed that their voices were altogether
too sweet.</p>

<p>"It's sickening to hear their songs," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_69" id="p_69">p. 69</a></span>
used to say. "Somebody ought to put a
stop to these concerts that we have to listen
to all summer long." And he was always
telling people that what he liked was
a good, loud, jarring call, that you could
hear without any trouble. "These soft,
musical notes are all nonsense!" he declared.</p>

<p>Jasper held it to be his duty, whenever
he chanced to come across one of those
forest concerts, to seat himself in a nearby
tree and make as much noise as he
could, in order to interrupt the singing.</p>

<p>Of course, such actions on the part of
Jasper Jay did not make the songsters of
Pleasant Valley like him any better. But
Jasper never minded that.</p>

<p>"I shall keep right on interrupting
these singing societies," he said, "until
I've put an end to such nuisances."</p>

<p>Naturally, that was only his way of look<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_70" id="p_70">p. 70</a></span>ing
at such matters. As for the other
birds, they thought that the real nuisance
was Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>Now, one of the finest singers in the
whole neighborhood was Buddy Brown-Thrasher.
Though he belonged to the
Pleasant Valley Singing Society, he sang
so well that he usually preferred to sing
by himself, instead of attending a singing
party. Each morning and each evening
he would seat himself in the topmost
branches of a tree near the thicket where
he lived; and there he would sing his favorite
song over and over again.</p>

<p>Often other birds some distance away
would cease their own music just to enjoy
his, for it was very beautiful. If a wooden
Indian had roamed through the woods
where Buddy Brown-Thrasher was singing,
he would have stopped to listen. Nobody
could have helped doing that.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_71" id="p_71">p. 71</a></span></p>

<p>At least, nobody could have helped listening
except Jasper Jay. In his opinion,
Buddy Brown-Thrasher was the most annoying
of all the feathered songsters. He
often went out of his way to interrupt
Buddy's evening-song. (In the morning
Jasper was in too great a hurry for his
breakfast to trouble himself in any such
fashion.)</p>

<p>Well, it is not surprising that Buddy
Brown-Thrasher should be upset by Jasper
Jay's provoking visits. It is scarcely
pleasant, when you are singing your best
notes in a tree-top, to have them suddenly
spoiled by a harsh <i>jay, jay</i>, and to be
mocked with boisterous laughter. The
time came at last when Buddy Brown-Thrasher
said he couldn't stand it any
longer.</p>

<p>"Something will have to be done!" he
declared. So he put on his thinking-cap<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_72" id="p_72">p. 72</a></span>
at once. Being a gentlemanly sort of person,
he never once thought of <i>fighting</i> Jasper
Jay. But he felt sure that there must
be some way to teach Jasper better manners.
He knew, however, that there was
no use of trying to reason with the rude
fellow. If he had merely talked with Jasper,
and asked him if he wouldn't please
do differently, Buddy Brown-Thrasher
would have received no more than a jeering
shout in reply.</p>

<p>Naturally, he hoped for something more
satisfactory than that.</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_73" id="p_73">p. 73</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h3>FINDING A WAY</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> can you do?" the other feathered
folk asked Buddy Brown-Thrasher, when
he complained about Jasper Jay's rudeness
in interrupting his singing. "You
don't intend to <i>fight</i> Jasper, do you?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;" replied Buddy&mdash;"I think
I can find a better way than that." And
that was all he would say.</p>

<p>As usual, Jasper came to Buddy Brown-Thrasher's
thicket that evening and
screamed his loudest, when Buddy began
to sing. Again Buddy's evening-song was
spoiled. And even before the noisy Jasper
had left, Buddy Brown-Thrasher be<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_74" id="p_74">p. 74</a></span>gan
to lay his plans for putting a stop to
Jasper's unpleasant trick. By the time
he fell asleep Buddy knew exactly what
he was going to do the next day.</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>The following morning Buddy Brown-Thrasher
was up bright and early&mdash;even
earlier than was his habit. And for once
in his life he did not pause to sing his
morning-song from his favorite perch in
the tree-top. He did not even wait to have
his breakfast, but flew straight to the
clump of young pines where&mdash;as he knew&mdash;Jasper
Jay made his home.</p>

<p>It was so early in the morning that a
gray light half veiled the mountains; and
a white mist hung over the river. The
Jay family was just beginning to awaken.
And soon Buddy heard Jasper's harsh
voice calling to some friend who lived a little
distance away.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_75" id="p_75">p. 75</a></span></p>

<p>Jasper was still somewhat sleepy.
Though Buddy Brown-Thrasher could not
see him, he could hear Jasper talking to
his wife in a low tone, which was quite different
from the noisy squawk that people
at once thought of at the mere mention of
Jasper Jay's name. And soon a few
sweet, flute-like notes came floating out
from Jasper's tree and fell upon the ears
of Buddy Brown-Thrasher, where he lay
snugly hidden among the boughs of a
young pine.</p>

<p>Buddy was delighted. You see, he was
a real music-lover; and seldom had he
heard any sound so beautiful as those rare
notes of Jasper Jay's.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" Buddy cried, without thinking
what he was doing. And in the next
instant Jasper Jay thrust a towsled head
through the pine-needles that screened his
sleeping-place.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_76" id="p_76">p. 76</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's there?" he shouted in a hoarse
and angry voice.</p>

<p>Buddy Brown-Thrasher did not answer.
He kept still as a mouse. And waited for
some time&mdash;hoping to hear Jasper's sweet
notes again&mdash;but he waited in vain.</p>

<p>But Buddy had heard them once. And
since it was for that very purpose that he
had gone without both his breakfast and
his morning-song, he was satisfied. He
went home a little later, feeling well
pleased, so far, with his plan for putting
an end to Jasper Jay's rudeness.</p>

<p>The first thing that Buddy Brown-Thrasher
did then was to seek his favorite
perch in the very top of his own special
tree and sing a morning-song that was
more joyous than ever. That was because
he was happier than he had been for a long
time&mdash;ever since Jasper Jay had been annoying
him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_77" id="p_77">p. 77</a></span></p>

<p>When he had sung his song fourteen
times, Buddy ate a hearty breakfast.
Feeling as sprightly as he did, he found
his appetite unusually keen. And when at
last he had finished his meal he went
straight off to make calls upon his friends.</p>

<p>Now, it was no accident that all those
upon whom Buddy Brown-Thrasher
called that morning belonged to the Pleasant
Valley Singing Society. You see,
Buddy needed help in order to teach Jasper
Jay a lesson. And as soon as his
friends heard his plan, they all told him
that it was a good one and that they would
be glad to do what they could to teach
Jasper Jay better manners.</p>

<h3>THE INVITATION</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning was not gone before Jasper
Jay had four callers. There was Bobbie
Bobolink, Jolly Robin, Miss Kitty Catbird
and Buddy Brown-Thrasher.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay was surprised to see them,
because it was seldom that anybody but
his relations called on him. Of course, if
one makes himself disagreeable&mdash;as Jasper
generally did&mdash;people do not go out of
their way to see him. But it was different
with Jasper Jay's relations. Some of
them were just as unmannerly and ill-bred
as he was. When they came to see Jasper
they were usually looking for a quarrel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_79" id="p_79">p. 79</a></span>
And they always found what they were
looking for at the house of their cousin,
Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>Naturally, he did not like to disappoint
his own cousins. He had even been known
to quarrel with his great-grandfather&mdash;which
is something most people refuse
flatly to do.</p>

<p>"Are you hunting for trouble?" Jasper
inquired, as he raised his crest and
snapped his bill together, looking as fierce
as he could.</p>

<p>Such conduct was enough to frighten
any lady. And it was no wonder that Jasper's
actions&mdash;as well as his words&mdash;sent
Miss Kitty Catbird into a flutter of alarm.
Her companions, however, told her there
was no danger. And Jolly Robin, who
was a bold fellow, hopped forward to do
the talking for the callers.</p>

<p>"We're a committee," said he, "chosen<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_80" id="p_80">p. 80</a></span>
to call on you and invite you to join the
Pleasant Valley Singing Society."</p>

<p>When he heard Jolly Robin's explanation,
Jasper Jay laughed in his callers'
faces.</p>

<p>"I'm not musical," he said. "And people
who get up early in the morning to
sing before breakfast always amuse me.
They're silly&mdash;that's what they are!" he
cried.</p>

<p>"Well, the Society wants you, all the
same," Jolly insisted.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay said nothing for a few moments.
He was thinking. And it occurred
to him, as he thought, that he could have a
good deal of sport by joining the Society
and spoiling its concerts. So he said at
last:</p>

<p>"I'll become a member of your Society
on one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Jolly Robin inquired.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_81" id="p_81">p. 81</a></span></p>

<p>"You must let me sing all I want to."</p>

<p>Jolly Robin looked at his companions.
And seeing that they all nodded their
heads, he asked Jasper if he would promise
to sing his best.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay said promptly that he
would. So Jolly told him that it was a
bargain. "You shall come to our next
meeting and make all the music you want
to," he promised.</p>

<p>So that was the way Jasper Jay became
a member of the Pleasant Valley Singing
Society.</p>

<p>"When's your next meeting?" Jasper
asked.</p>

<p>"To-night, just before sunset!" Jolly
replied. "We'll gather in the maple
grove, near the sugar-house. And we'll
look for you."</p>

<p>"I'll be there without fail," Jasper Jay
assured him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_82" id="p_82">p. 82</a></span></p>

<p>The committee left him then. And Jasper's
unpleasant laughter rang in their
ears for a long time afterward.</p>

<p>But when he stopped laughing, Jasper
decided to keep very still for the rest of
the day. He wanted to save his voice for
the concert at sunset.</p>

<h3>THE SINGING SOCIETY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the members of the Pleasant Valley
Singing Society gathered just before
sunset in the maple grove, near the sugar-house
(where Cuffy Bear first saw a man),
they were glad to find that Jasper Jay
was already there, waiting for them.</p>

<p>Now, a smallish, cinnamon-colored
young gentleman named Valentine Veery,
who was a distant cousin of Jolly Robin's,
was the singing leader. He had been
chosen on account of his being able to sing
both alto and soprano at the same time.
And as soon as everybody had found a
comfortable seat for himself, Valentine
Veery said:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_84" id="p_84">p. 84</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad to see we have a new member
with us this evening; and I hope he
will enjoy himself and sing his very
best."</p>

<p>Everybody looked at Jasper Jay. And
you might think he would have felt the
least bit uncomfortable. But he only
laughed loudly and replied that if he
didn't have a good time it wouldn't be <i>his</i>
fault.</p>

<p>Then Valentine Veery bowed politely&mdash;which
was more than Jasper Jay had done&mdash;and
announced that "Good-night, Ladies!"
would be the first song.</p>

<p>So all the company began to sing, including
Jasper Jay. Although he knew
neither the words nor the music, he
shrieked at the top of his voice. But they
hadn't sung more than a few lines before
the leader made them stop.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong somewhere,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_85" id="p_85">p. 85</a></span>
said Valentine Veery. "Has anybody a
cold in his head?"</p>

<p>But everyone, including Jasper Jay, declared
that he never was in better health
in his life.</p>

<p>"We'll try again, then," the leader told
them.</p>

<p>So they started once more. And once
more Valentine Veery stopped them.</p>

<p>"This is terrible!" he said with a shudder.
"Who is it, please, that is off the
key?"</p>

<p>Nobody answered. But everybody
looked at Jasper Jay again. And you
would think that this time he certainly
would have felt most uncomfortable. But
he only grinned as if he were enjoying
himself hugely.</p>

<p>"We'll try the song just once more,"
little Mr. Veery told them. But it was no
use. He stopped the singing quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_86" id="p_86">p. 86</a></span>
"We can't go on like this," he declared.
"The only thing to be done is to let each
member sing the song alone. And in that
way we shall find out who's out of tune.
We'll let our oldest member sing first, and
the newest one last," he directed.</p>

<p>So old Mr. Mockingbird, who was the
first member of the Pleasant Valley Singing
Society&mdash;and about the only one of
his family in the neighborhood&mdash;sang the
song in his best manner. And after him
the others had their turn, until everybody
had sung "Good-night, Ladies!" except
the newest member of all.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;" said Valentine Veery&mdash;"now
everyone must keep very still while we
have the pleasure of listening to Jasper
Jay."</p>

<p>Of course, after hearing the song repeated
so many times, Jasper couldn't
help learning a little of it. He began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_87" id="p_87">p. 87</a></span>
bellow "Good-night, Ladies!" in the
harshest, most ear-splitting tones he knew.
Some of his listeners hurriedly tucked
their heads under their wings, to shut out
the horrid sound. And as for Miss Kitty
Catbird, she actually left the meeting and
flew straight home, because she felt that
she must scream if she stayed there any
longer. Having a sensitive ear, she could
not endure Jasper's rasping voice. In her
opinion, it sounded more like a buzz saw
than anything else.</p>

<h3>JASPER IS ASHAMED</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> leader of the Singing Society stopped
Jasper Jay's song as soon as he was able
to. But Jolly Robin's cousin, Valentine
Veery, found it no easy matter to silence
Jasper Jay. Though he called to him several
times, Jasper paid no attention to
him, but continued to make all the noise he
could. His notes had never sounded so
loud and harsh before&mdash;but you must remember
that Jasper had been saving his
voice all day for this very occasion.</p>

<p>At last Valentine Veery launched his
small, cinnamon-colored body straight at
Jasper Jay and gave him a sharp nudge<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_89" id="p_89">p. 89</a></span>
with his wing. And at that Jasper
stopped singing.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked in an
angry voice.</p>

<p>"Matter?" said Valentine Veery.
"Why, you're all wrong. You're not only
twisting the words of the song, but you
don't know the air at all. It's plain to
see that it was you that made our concert
sound so queerly."</p>

<p>Jasper Jay jeered openly at the little
leader.</p>

<p>"The trouble&mdash;" said Jasper&mdash;"the
real trouble is that you and your friends
don't know this song. I'm the only one
that can sing it correctly."</p>

<p>Everybody exclaimed that Jasper was
a ridiculous fellow.</p>

<p>"The committee that invited me to
come here told me that I might sing as
much as I wanted to. And here you've<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_90" id="p_90">p. 90</a></span>
gone and stopped me!" Jasper Jay complained.</p>

<p>Then Buddy Brown-Thrasher cried out
in a clear voice that Jasper wasn't trying
his best, as he had promised the committee
he would.</p>

<p>"In fact," said Buddy, "I'm quite sure
he's trying his <i>worst</i>."</p>

<p>Jasper Jay looked quite fierce when he
heard that remark.</p>

<p>"It's not so&mdash;and you can't prove it!"
he screamed.</p>

<p>The little leader turned to Buddy
Brown-Thrasher and said:</p>

<p>"What have you to say to that?"</p>

<p>This was what Buddy Brown-Thrasher
had been waiting for.</p>

<p>"I'd like to state," he announced, "that
Jasper Jay can sing very well&mdash;when he
wants to. He has always pretended that
singing was silly. And you know what a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_91" id="p_91">p. 91</a></span>
nuisance he makes of himself spoiling a
good song whenever he happens to hear
one. Why, I've heard him sing beautifully!"</p>

<p>"You never!" howled Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have&mdash;this very morning!"
Buddy Brown-Thrasher retorted. "I was
in the young pine woods where he lives
and I heard Jasper sing to his wife&mdash;lovely,
flute-like notes they were. But I can
see that he's ashamed to admit it."</p>

<p>Jasper Jay was so surprised that he
opened and closed his bill several times
without saying anything at all. It was
not often that he was at a loss for words.
And some of those present couldn't help
smiling.</p>

<p>Jasper noticed their amusement.</p>

<p>"This is just a trick!" he squawked.
"You invited me to your Singing Society
to tease me!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_92" id="p_92">p. 92</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, his words were not
far from the truth.</p>

<p>"Let us hear your best notes, Jasper!"
somebody called. And others cried,
"Yes!" and "Please!" and "We're waiting!"</p>

<p>But Jasper Jay would do nothing but
stamp his feet and hop up and down and
snap his bill together and scold. He made
such a funny sight that the whole Singing
Society began to laugh at him, until he
flew away with one last frantic scream of
rage.</p>

<p>Then the Pleasant Valley Singing Society
had one of the most enjoyable meetings
it had ever held. And though Jasper
Jay showed a very sulky face to everybody
for several days, it was a long time
before he spoiled any songs that he happened
to hear. And he never annoyed
Buddy Brown-Thrasher again.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_93" id="p_93">p. 93</a></span></p>

<p>Morning and evening Buddy went to
his favorite perch and sang to his heart's
content.</p>

<p>For Jasper Jay had learned a lesson at
last.</p>

<h3>ENEMIES</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper Jay</span> was not the only bird that
liked beechnuts. Reddy Woodpecker was
fond of them, too. And when he saw that
the beechnut crop was going to be a big
one he decided that he would stay in Pleasant
Valley all winter.</p>

<p>Jasper and Reddy were not unlike in
some other respects, too. Both were noisy,
quarrelsome ruffians, who did not hesitate
to steal and devour the eggs and young of
other birds. Furthermore, both of them
were gay-colored&mdash;but in a very different
way. Jasper Jay always wore a brilliant
blue suit, while Reddy Woodpecker made<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_95" id="p_95">p. 95</a></span>
himself easily seen by donning a bright
red cap, which came down to his shoulders
and gave him an odd look. Being so much
alike (as far as manners were concerned),
the two quarreled whenever they met.
And when Jasper Jay heard that Reddy
had made up his mind to spend the winter
in the North he was furious.</p>

<p>"It's an outrage!" he declared to
Jimmy Rabbit, who had told him about
Reddy Woodpecker's plan. "He needn't
think he can stay in this neighborhood and
eat most of the nuts&mdash;for I know him and
I know what he expects to do."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit saw at once that there
was going to be some fun&mdash;for him. And
he didn't want to miss any of it.</p>

<p>"I suppose&mdash;&mdash;" he said to Jasper&mdash;"I
suppose you'd like to drive Reddy Woodpecker
away from Pleasant Valley?"</p>

<p>Jasper laughed hoarsely.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_96" id="p_96">p. 96</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd not only <i>like</i> to&mdash;I'm <i>going</i> to!"
he said.</p>

<p>"How do you intend to do it?" Jimmy
asked him.</p>

<p>"I'll have to think a while before I decide,"
Jasper Jay replied.</p>

<p>"You'll find it pretty difficult," Jimmy
Rabbit said. "Let me arrange the matter
for you! I'll promise you to put Reddy
Woodpecker where he can't eat any beechnuts.
And so long as I do that for you, I
suppose you don't care what happens."</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" said Jasper Jay.
"Though, of course, if you could arrange
things so I didn't have to <i>see</i> Reddy I'd
like that. His red cap is hideous. It's
enough to make anybody ill, just to see
it."</p>

<p>"I think I can please you," said Jimmy
Rabbit. "But you'll have to do exactly
as I say, or my plan won't work."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_97" id="p_97">p. 97</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Jasper Jay was really not at all
eager to fight Reddy Woodpecker. Reddy
had a very sharp bill, which was even
longer than Jasper's, and just as strong.
And Reddy could strike a powerful blow
with his bill. So Jasper Jay was glad
enough to accept help from a person like
Jimmy Rabbit, who was always thinking
of new schemes.</p>

<p>"I'll leave everything to you," said Jasper.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Jimmy Rabbit. "And
now you must wait right where I tell you
to, while I go to find Reddy Woodpecker.
Follow me!" he ordered.</p>

<p>And Jasper Jay followed him, while
Jimmy skipped briskly through the
woods. He appeared to be looking for
something. And at last he seemed to have
found it, in a swampy hollow where water
stood here and there in pools. Anyhow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_98" id="p_98">p. 98</a></span>
he stopped beside a cedar tree and said
to Jasper Jay:</p>

<p>"You must stand beside this tree; and
you mustn't stir out of your tracks."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit pointed out the exact
spot where he wanted Jasper Jay to station
himself. And since it happened that
there was a puddle of water there, it was
only to be expected that Jasper Jay should
begin to grumble.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_99" id="p_99">p. 99</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>

<h3>COLD FEET</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Yes!</span> Jasper Jay looked sulky when
Jimmy Rabbit told him to stand in the
puddle of water, close beside the cedar
tree.</p>

<p>"How long do you want me to stay
here?" Jasper growled. "I can tell you
that it's not very pleasant to stand in a
pool of water a great while&mdash;on a cold
day like this."</p>

<p>Now, all this happened quite late in the
fall. And it was true that the day was a
cold one. In fact, the weather seemed to
be growing colder every minute.</p>

<p>"I won't ask you to wait any longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_100" id="p_100">p. 100</a></span>
than is necessary," said Jimmy Rabbit.
"And if you want me to put Reddy Woodpecker
where he can't eat any nuts, and
you don't have to <i>see</i> him, you must follow
my directions.... When you're ill
and go to Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the
herb doctor, you always take her advice,
don't you?"</p>

<p>Jasper admitted that he did.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you must do just as I say.
You know, it always makes you ill to look
at Reddy Woodpecker. And I'm going
to cure you, if you'll only give me a
chance."</p>

<p>So Jasper Jay went and stood in the
puddle. He screamed a good deal as he
stepped into the cold water.</p>

<p>"This is terrible!" he groaned. "Do
hurry with your scheme, or I shall have a
chill."</p>

<p>"Remember! You're to keep absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_101" id="p_101">p. 101</a></span>
still!" Jimmy Rabbit warned him. "You
mustn't move and you mustn't talk. If
you should, my plan would be spoiled; and
then you would have to fight Reddy Woodpecker
after all."</p>

<p>"I pr-pr-promise!" said Jasper Jay.
His bill was chattering so fast that he
could hardly talk. And he was so cold
that he looked uncommonly blue&mdash;even
for a blue jay.</p>

<p>So Jimmy Rabbit hopped away, feeling
quite pleased with himself and his plan.
If Jasper Jay could have seen him stop,
as soon as he was out of sight, and roll
over and over upon the ground and hold
his shaking sides he might have wondered
what Jimmy was laughing at. Certainly
Jasper Jay could see no joke in standing
still in a cold puddle on a frosty fall day.</p>

<p>Well, after a time Jimmy Rabbit
stopped rolling upon the ground and hurried<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_102" id="p_102">p. 102</a></span>
straight to the place where the
beeches grew. And there&mdash;as he had
hoped to&mdash;he found Reddy Woodpecker,
busily eating beechnuts.</p>

<p>"How are the nuts this fall?" Jimmy
Rabbit asked.</p>

<p>"They couldn't be better!" said Reddy,
stuffing his mouth as he spoke.</p>

<p>"They say there's a big crop this year,"
Jimmy Rabbit observed.</p>

<p>"Yes!" replied Reddy. "But it's none
too big. In fact, there are too many people
in this neighborhood that come here
for nuts. I hope," he said, "that's not
what you're looking for."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit laughed.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" he said. "I'm satisfied
to leave the nuts for you and Jasper
Jay to eat. I want none of them."</p>

<p>"Jasper Jay!" screamed Reddy Woodpecker.
"Don't mention that rowdy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_103" id="p_103">p. 103</a></span>
name to me, please! He's the greediest
of all! And he's so vain&mdash;so proud of that
sky-blue suit of his&mdash;that I can't bear the
sight of him. I wish I could put him
where he couldn't eat any more of these
beechnuts, and where I wouldn't have to
look at him, either!"</p>

<p>Of course, that was not at all an agreeable
remark for him to make.</p>

<p>But it seemed to please Jimmy Rabbit
greatly.</p>

<h3>GETTING RID OF JASPER</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Have</span> you finished your meal?" Jimmy
Rabbit asked Reddy Woodpecker, as they
faced each other among the beech trees.</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;I can't say I have," replied
Reddy. "When I begin to eat beechnuts
I never want to stop. It's something I
can't help. And I've been told that Johnnie
Green is just like that when he gets a
taste of peanuts. You might say that I'll
have only one meal all winter long. It
started as soon as the beechnuts began to
ripen; and it won't be ended until the last
nut is gone."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit couldn't help smiling.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_105" id="p_105">p. 105</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow, you can't be really hungry,"
he said. "And if you'll come with me and
do just as I tell you, you'll find that Jasper
Jay won't trouble you for a good, long
time."</p>

<p>"Wait a little while!" Reddy Woodpecker
begged him. "I want to eat just
a few more beechnuts; and then I'll come
with you."</p>

<p>"Hurry, then!" said Jimmy Rabbit.
And he watched anxiously while Reddy
Woodpecker broke open more beechnuts
with his strong bill and greedily ate the
sweet meats.</p>

<p>"Come! come!" Jimmy Rabbit urged
him.</p>

<p>"Just one more!" Reddy pleaded.</p>

<p>That happened several times, until at
last Jimmy Rabbit said that he couldn't
wait any longer, and that he was sorry,
because he knew he could have helped<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_106" id="p_106">p. 106</a></span>
Reddy in a way that would have pleased
him.</p>

<p>He started off then. And at that Reddy
Woodpecker hurried after him.</p>

<p>"I think I've eaten enough so I can
manage to stay away from the beechnuts
a short time," he said with a sigh. "But
I hope you won't keep me long."</p>

<p>"Everything depends on the weather,"
Jimmy Rabbit answered.</p>

<p>But Reddy Woodpecker did not even
hear him. His mind was too busy thinking
of beechnuts to pay much attention
to anything else.</p>

<p>They travelled through the woods for
some time, until they reached a low,
swampy place. And as soon as they came
to it Jimmy Rabbit whispered to Reddy
Woodpecker that he must be very still.</p>

<p>"Do exactly as I tell you," he ordered.
"And don't even whisper to me, please!<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_107" id="p_107">p. 107</a></span>
I'm going to show you where you must
stand. Though the place may not be as
dry as you might prefer, you'll have to
follow my directions and say nothing&mdash;if
you want to get rid of Jasper Jay."</p>

<p>"I promise&mdash;" said Reddy Woodpecker&mdash;"but
I wish I had brought along a few
beechnuts in my pocket. Just wait a moment!"
he added. "Let me see if I haven't
some nuts somewhere that I've forgotten."</p>

<p>So Jimmy Rabbit waited while Reddy
hunted in all his pockets. He turned
every one of them inside out. And since
he had fifteen pockets, and he had to turn
them all back again, and replace their contents,
the proceeding consumed a good deal
of time.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit grew very impatient. He
kept urging Reddy Woodpecker to make
haste. But Reddy told him that if he hur<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_108" id="p_108">p. 108</a></span>ried
too much he might overlook a beechnut.
So he took his own time.</p>

<p>But the search was all in vain. Not a
single nut did he find.</p>

<p>Then Jimmy Rabbit led him silently to
a great cedar tree and bade him stand behind
it and keep perfectly still.</p>

<p>Reddy made a wry face when he saw
that he must put his feet in a deep puddle
of water. But he obeyed, all the same.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_109" id="p_109">p. 109</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI</h2>

<h3>TWO RASCALS CAUGHT</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moment Reddy Woodpecker stepped
into the cold water he wanted to say
"Ouch!" But Jimmy Rabbit put a finger
on his mouth&mdash;meaning that Reddy must
be still as a mouse.</p>

<p>So the red-capped scamp managed to
keep quiet, though it was such hard work
that he began to feel terribly hungry.
Jimmy Rabbit watched him for a short
time, smiling and nodding his head, as if
to say:</p>

<p>"That's right! Just do as I say and all
will be well." And then he waved a sort
of farewell, before he disappeared.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_110" id="p_110">p. 110</a></span></p>

<p>Though Reddy did not know it, Jimmy
Rabbit stopped as soon as he was out of
sight and crept behind a bush, from which
hiding-place he could watch the cedar tree,
without being seen by the two beechnut
lovers who stood so still beside it&mdash;for
there was Jasper Jay, standing in a puddle
on one side of the big tree, and there
was Reddy Woodpecker, standing in another
puddle on the opposite side of the
tree!</p>

<p>And neither of them knew that the other
was anywhere around!</p>

<p>But there was one thing that they knew
quite well: the water was almost colder
than they could bear, at first. If their feet
hadn't grown numb, after a time, so that
there was no feeling in them at all, they
wouldn't have been able to stand there so
still and so long.</p>

<p>They both wondered where Jimmy Rab<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_111" id="p_111">p. 111</a></span>bit
was, and what he was doing, and why
he didn't come back.</p>

<p>But Jimmy Rabbit was waiting for
something. As he had told Reddy Woodpecker,
everything depended on the
weather. Though the air was becoming
sharper every minute, it was not yet cold
enough to suit Jimmy Rabbit. What he
wanted was <i>freezing</i> weather. And at last
he was satisfied. When the sun hid itself
behind a bank of clouds the ground began
to stiffen with frost, which covered all the
puddles and pools with a coating of ice.</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>It was almost dark when Jimmy Rabbit
left the shelter of his bush and danced
up and down to get warm. Soon he came
with a hop, skip and a jump to the big
cedar tree.</p>

<p>"How are you?" he called.</p>

<p>And two very sulky voices answered:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_112" id="p_112">p. 112</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm cold&mdash;that's how I am!"</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you dance around and
get warm?" Jimmy asked.</p>

<p>But both Reddy Woodpecker and Jasper
Jay were caught fast by their feet in
the frozen puddles. And as soon as they
tried to move they began to squall loudly&mdash;because
they were so frightened. They
could no more have danced than the old
cedar tree could have pulled up its roots
and capered about in the forest. So far
as they could see, they might as well have
stepped into any of the traps that Johnnie
Green set for Peter Mink.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that they were
alarmed&mdash;no wonder that they struggled
to free themselves.</p>

<p>"You seem to like to stay by that tree,"
said Jimmy Rabbit.</p>

<p>Now, since Jasper and Reddy had
wanted exactly the same things to happen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_113" id="p_113">p. 113</a></span>
and since they were now in the same fix,
Jimmy Rabbit could talk to them both at
the same time. What he said to one fitted
the other just as well.</p>

<p>Of course, that made it very easy for
Jimmy Rabbit.</p>

<p>But it was rather hard on Reddy
Woodpecker and Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>"<i>Jay! jay!</i>" screamed Jasper in a
rasping voice, like a saw biting into a log.
"<i>Ker-r-ruck! ker-r-ruck!</i>" sounded Reddy's
rolling call. And they began to scold
Jimmy Rabbit, until he put his paws over
his ears and ran away.</p>

<p>If it hadn't been for Reddy Woodpecker's
strong bill they might have
stayed in the cedar swamp all winter.
But he set to work and soon chopped himself
free. Then he helped Jasper Jay.
And before it was dark they flew away
together and went straight to the beech<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_114" id="p_114">p. 114</a></span>nut
grove, where they ate a huge meal
of beechnuts, without having a single dispute
about anything.</p>

<p>On the contrary, they agreed perfectly
in every way. Especially they agreed
that Jimmy Rabbit was a busybody and
that somebody ought to teach him better
manners.</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to help you do that,"
said Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>It was actually funny that two such
rowdies should talk of another's bad manners.
But no doubt such an idea never
entered their heads.</p>
